### Objective:
Analyze employee absenteeism data to identify trends, reward healthy behaviors, and calculate the financial impact of compensation adjustments. Present insights in an interactive Power BI dashboard for decision-making.

### Description:
The queries integrate absenteeism records, compensation data, and reasons for absence, identifying employees meeting health criteria (e.g., non-smokers, low BMI). Additionally, they calculate the budget impact for salary increases based on health metrics. The data is visualized in Power BI, showcasing key metrics such as absenteeism trends, employee demographics, and correlations between workload, transportation expenses, and absenteeism.

### Skills:
- SQL for data extraction, integration, and analysis
- Data visualization and reporting using Power BI
- Advanced analytics with conditional logic and categorization (CASE statements)
- Trend analysis and KPI development
### Technology:
- SQL (compatible with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or similar)
- Power BI for dashboard design and interactive reporting
- Relational database systems for data storage and querying
### Results:
- Data Insights: Key KPIs such as average absenteeism time (6.92 hours) and total absenteeism hours (5124) were calculated and visualized.
- Employee Analysis: Pie charts categorized employees by education, pet ownership, social drinking, and smoking habits.
- Trends and Patterns: Line charts identified absenteeism peaks by month and day of the week, revealing critical periods such as higher absenteeism in July.
- Comparative Analysis: Transportation expenses and workload correlations were visualized to identify cost-driving factors.
- Interactive Reporting: The Power BI dashboard provided HR teams with actionable insights for developing health and compensation policies, targeting systemic issues, and optimizing absenteeism management.
