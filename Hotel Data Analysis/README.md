### Objective:
Analyze revenue and operational data from hotel records (2018â€“2020) to identify performance trends and provide insights into revenue distribution, customer segmentation, and resource allocation. Present findings through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

### Description:
The SQL script combines data from multiple yearly datasets (2018, 2019, 2020) into a unified table, enriching it with additional information from related tables like market segments and meal costs. The integrated data is visualized in Power BI to display key metrics such as total revenue, average daily rate (ADR), and parking requirements. The dashboard also highlights revenue trends by hotel type and the contribution of each year to total revenue.

### Skills:
- SQL for data integration and cleaning (UNION, JOIN operations)
- Data modeling and relationship handling across multiple tables
- Dashboard creation and interactivity in Power BI
- Trend and KPI analysis (e.g., ADR, revenue distribution)
### Technology:
- SQL (applicable to Microsoft SQL Server or equivalent)
- Power BI for interactive reporting and visualization
- Relational database for data storage and querying

### Results:
- Data Insights: Total revenue of $10.23M with ADR of $104.47 and 367.78K total nights booked.
- Revenue Breakdown: Pie chart reveals revenue split between City Hotels (46.38%) and Resort Hotels (53.62%).
- Trends Analysis: Line charts display revenue performance over time, identifying seasonal peaks and periods of high demand.
- Operational Metrics: Parking requirements and discounts are analyzed, aiding resource allocation and marketing strategies.
- Interactive Reporting: Power BI dashboard allows filtering by hotel type, year, and country, enabling dynamic exploration of performance drivers.
